	 * SECOND MEMBER: METHODS
	 * 	A method does computations that access the class's instance variables
	 * 
	 * Classes tend to have TWO KINDS OF METHODS:
	 * 1. Accessor Methods:
	 * 		An accessor method gives information about an object without altering the object.
	 * 		Often short, just returning the value of an instance variable or performing a computation
	 * 		Have no parameters - all the necessary information is in the instance variables
	 * 		Have no preconditions 
	 * 				For the throttle can return infromation but it cannot change the position of the lever
	 * 2. Modification Method
	 * 		A modification method can change the status of an object.
	 * 			For the throttle, it can shift the lever up or down
	 * 
	 * Each class method is d
