	Chapter 2

	Introduction:
		+Object Oriented Programming is an approach to programming in which data occurs in tidy packages called 'objects'
		+Manipulation of an object happens with 'functions called methods'
		+the Java mechanism to create objects and methods is called a class
			-the keyword class at the start of each Java application program indicates that the program itself is a class with its own method to carry out the tasks
		+programmers  who use the classes must be provided with a specification of how the classes work, but they need no knowledge of how the classes are implemented
			-information hiding: the seperation of specification from implementantion
+mathematical data types are called abstract data types (ADTs)
			-programmers sometimes use the term ADT to refer to a class that is presented to other programmers with information hiding
	
	2.1 Classes and their Members:
		+a 'class' is a new kind of 'data type'
			-each of your classes includes various data such as integers, characters, and so on
			-a class has the ability to include two other kinds of items
				-'constructors'
					-designed to provide initial values to the class data
				-'methods'
					-desgined to manipulate the data
			-taken together: the data, constructors, and methods of a class are called the class 'members'
