	Chapter 2

	Introduction:
		+Object Oriented Programming is an approach to programming in which data occurs in tidy packages called 'objects'
		+Manipulation of an object happens with 'functions called methods'
		+the Java mechanism to create objects and methods is called a class
			-the keyword class at the start of each Java application program indicates that the program itself is a class with its own method to carry out the tasks
		+programmers  who use the classes must be provided with a specification of how the classes work, but they need no knowledge of how the classes are implemented
			-information hiding: the seperation of specification from implementantion
	+mathematical data types are called abstract data types (ADTs)
			-programmers sometimes use the term ADT to refer to a class that is presented to other programmers with information hiding
	
	2.1 Classes and their Members:
		+a 'class' is a new kind of 'data type'
			-each of your classes includes various data such as integers, characters, and so on
			-a class has the ability to include two other kinds of items
				-'constructors'
					-designed to provide initial values to the class data
				-'methods'
					-desgined to manipulate the data
			-taken together: the data, constructors, and methods of a class are called the class 'members'
	Notes while doing the Throttle example:

/*
 * Notes:
 * Keyword: public 
 * 	+Is necessary before class because we want to allow other programmers (the public) to use the new class
 * 
 * Syntax: always use a capital letter for the first character of names of new classes
 * 
 * The rest of the class definition, between the two brackets {} is a list of all the components of the class
 * 	+these components are called members of the class (3 types)
 *			-instance variables
 *			-constructors
 *			-methods
*/
/* 
 * First kind of member: Variable Declaration
 * 	These variables are called instance variables
 * 
 * Keyword: private
 * 	+Means that programmers who use the new class have no way to read or assign values directly to the private instance variables
 * 	+Possible to have public instance variables accessed directly
 * 		-BUT public instance vars reveal TOO MUCH information about how a class is implemented, violating the principle of information hiding
 */

/* 
 * Second kind of member: Constructors
 * 	A constructor is a method that is responsible for INITIALIZING the instance varibles
 * 	The primary difference between constructor and other methods is:
 * 		a constructor has access to the class's instance variables, and is responsible for initializing these variables
 * 
 * RULES FOR CONSTRUCTORS:
 * 	+before any constructor begins its work, ALL instance variables are assinged Java "default values"
 * 	+if an instance var has a initialization value with its declaration, the initialization value replaces the default values
 * 			example: int jackie = 42; and the default value is zero, then the zero is replaced by the initialization value of 42
 * 	+the name of a constructor must be the same as the name of the class (at least for Java)
 * 	+a constructor is not really a method, and therefore it does not require a return value
 * 		-DO NOT WRITE VOID OR ANY OTHER RETURN TYPE AT THE FRON OF THE CONSTRUCTOR'S HEAD
 * 		-the compiler knows that every constructor has no return value
 * 
 * If there are several constructors, then each constructor must have a distinct sequence of parameters to distringuish it from
 * the other constructors
 * 
 * NO-ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTORS
 * 	+Some classes have a constructor with no parameters
 * 	+a no-arguments constructor does not need any extra information to set the initial values of the instance variables
 * 	+if you write a class with no constructors at all, then Java automatically provides a no-arguments constructor that 
 * 		initializes each instance var to its initialization value or to its default value
 *
