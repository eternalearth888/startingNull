 * 
 * Syntax: always use a capital letter for the first character of names of new classes
 * 
 * The rest of the class definition, between the two brackets {} is a list of all the components of the class
 * 	+these components are called members of the class (3 types)
 *			-instance variables
 *			-constructors
 *			-methods
