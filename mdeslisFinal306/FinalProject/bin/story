Young Mint Pudding, a charming pony full of heart with a big appetite, 
sees the glorious strawberry cake crafted by the best bakers in all of 
the land one day as she trots home. Against the better judgment of her 
friends (and her own common sense) she decides that she has to launch 
herself from a catapult in order to consume the cake. So, Mint Pudding 
risks her life to catapult with your help (and immense knowledge of 
angles and trajectories) and hopefully hit the glorious cake of strawberry. 
With each successful launch on the cake, Mint Pudding will devour a layer 
of the cake (she has a VERY big mouth), but with each failed attempt, she 
will lose a portion of her health. If she fails to consume all of the cake 
before her health is depleted, little Mint Pudding will not see the next sunrise
