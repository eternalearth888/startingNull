	Observations about java:
		+Java-like syntax
		+Comments like C/C++/Java
		+Standard libraries
		+a typical OO language
		

		+A Jack program has a collection of one or more classes
			+A Jack class is a collection of one or more subroutines
				+A Jack subroutine can be a function, a method, or a constructor
		+THERE MUST BE ONE MAIN CLASS AND ONE OF ITS METHODS MUST BE MAIN
