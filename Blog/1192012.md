	*FOUR REASONS TO IMPLEMENT ACCESSOR METHODS*
	1) A programmer who uses the throttle does not need to worry about how it is implemented
	2) Allows for later changes of the implementation of the throttle
		+perhaps adding a new member variable that always keep track of current flow
		+NOTE: Programs that use the throttle will still work correctly after we make such changes, provided we have one set of accessor mathods whose implementations do not change
	3)When a class implements an accessor method, that method can be tested and thus realibility is increased.
		+Without accesor methods, each program that uses the class is prone to the same potential errors. 
		+example: one potential error in the getFlow method is a division error 
	4)the patter of "private data, public methods" forbids other programmers from using our instance variables in unintended ways
		+example: setting a position to a negative value in throttle

	*USING BOOLEAN TYPE FOR TRUE OR FALSE VALUES*
	+you should use the boolean type for any true or false value

	*MODIFICATION METHODS*
	+modification methods: methods that are capable of changing the values of the instance variables	
	+modification mehtods are usually void
		+meaning there is no return value

	*ARITHMETIC OVERFLOW*
	+Arithmetic ovrerflow is defined as trying to compute or store a number that is beyond the legal range od that data type
	+when arithmetic overflow occurs, the program might stop with an error message, or it might continue computing the wrong data

	+potential arithmetic overflows:
		+check arithmetic expressions for potential arithmetic overflow
		+limits can be found online and in books
