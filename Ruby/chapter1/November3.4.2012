So I am already a little bit behind but with good reason.

I spent most of the 3rd and 4th setting up github and becoming familiar with the commands. I also struggled with getting Ruby to compile and run in Windows 7. Still no luck but that's okay - I'll stick to my Linux laptop for now.

I was only able to get through half of chapter 1 so far in my Ruby book - it's super long!

This is what I learned so far:

a)Ruby is a pretty straightforward language.
	- It basically is the best example of the saying, 'it is what it is'.
	- You do not necessarily have to declare things ahead of time
	- Just make it when you need it

b)There are two ways to print something to the string. 
	1) print: allows the cursor to remain on the same line as the prompt
		example: Enter your name:_
	2) puts: adds a line feed at the end of the printed string
		example: My name is Maria
			 _

c)gets() is used to read in a string up until the user presses ENTER or RETURN
	-it does not require parantheses
	-it can be assigned to a variable
		example: assigning it to a string; name = gets()

d)Ruby is case sensitive
	-myvar != myVar
	-if a variable name starts with an uppercase letter, it is considered a constant
	
e)embedding a variable into a string can be done as follows
	example: "Hello #{name}"
	NOTE: it must be done with double quotes or else it will actually print 		out Hello #{name} instead of Hello Maria

f)You can embed nonprinting characters as well
	-\n makes a new lines
	-\t tabs

g)Order of Operations is the same as C++/Java
	-so far

h)Testing a Condition can be done with if..then statement
	example: if (count < 0.0) then
			count = 0
		end

	-it reminds me a little of FORTRAN in this case

i)Local and Global Variables
	-variables that start with lowercase letters are called local variables
		-local variable means that the variable exists only within a specific part of a program
			-they are restricted/limited to a defined area
	-global variables are not limited and can be used throughtout the program
		-this is an example of how to initiate one:  $globalvar = "goodbye"
		-must have $ prior to any letters for global variables
