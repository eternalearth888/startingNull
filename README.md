Who am I?

	My name is Maria Deslis. I am juniour in Computer Science.
	I am also struggling, frustrated, and above all...lost.
****************
What am I doing?

	My plan is to make change in my life.

	Despite my current struggles, I love Computer Science with all my heart and I still have a strong thirst for learning as much as I can.		Perhaps the reason I am struggling and confused is because I am simply burnt out.
	Perhaps I wasn't studying correctly. Perhaps the way I was being taught was not working for me.
	The bottom line is, things need to change.

	My plan, is to just start at the beginning.

Why am I doing this?	

	Starting over is not easy. Especally being in the middle of getting my degree in the thing I am struggling with. 

	The difference between what I am doing here versus what I am doing in the classroom is simple:
	I am taking it one step at a time, at my own pace. Without the pressure/anxiety of grades/school.
	I am giving myself the space to fail without the consequences having a profound effect on my life and pursuit in education.

	The reality is, the only way to learn is to fail. To be banging your head against the wall over and over until it clicks (metaphorically speaking of course).
	The problem lies in reality as well though.
	We are taught from when we are young that failure means lazy, dumb, etc. 
	That shouldn't be the case, but it is. 
	If we fail in class we don't have the time to go back and try again, the class keeps going and you end up falling behind farther and farther, and we up spending more time struggling and frustrated (my situation) than we do actually being able to learn. 
	Spending countless hours and studying, going to office hours, doing review only to end up making everything worse. 
	If we fail a class we have to take it again. And if you have to take a class too many times one of two (or sometimes both) things happen:

	1) You begin to doubt your ability (gaining other negative feelings as well) with the thing you love. Thus putting you in a vicious cycle.	

	2) You get in trouble with the school (probation, kicked out, etc.)
		
	I know that the above things does not apply to everyone and everything, but it does seem to be the general consensus. 

	And it's definitley been my experience.

	I have tried many things and they have either not worked or made things worse. 

	So I am trying it a different way.

Why GitHub?

	Much like an artist or a writer is able to see the progression of their skill and ability by being able to see the many past works they have created, so will GitHub and it's commit history allow me to see the progression I make as a computer scientist.

How do you plan to do this?

	Here are the basic rules on how I plan to make this happen:

	1) Spend a minimum of two hours a day going through a chapter in a book and just doing it and reading it.
		a) Consider doing at least 4 on weekend days

	2) When you are done with that chapter
		a) Append to the 'Learning File'
	
	3) Review your commits and realize your accomplishments

	4) Take it one day at a time

	5) Do NOT rush

	6) Make it a public repository so that you feel as though someone is holding you accountable
		a) Don't make it easy to stop what you are doing

	7) You must do this for at least 30-days
		a) Starting December 16, 2012
		b) Ending January 8, 2012

	8) Slowness != Laziness; Just go one step at a time
	
	9)When done with your 30 days
		a)Summize what you learned
		b)Talk about it in a way that would make it easy for someone who doesn't know anything about computer science to learn from
