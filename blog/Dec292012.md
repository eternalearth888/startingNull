	My, my...hasn't it been awhile, no?

	I know that I have promised myself many things and have set some rules
for myself - but you know. Sometimes, it's not work time. Sometimes it is time to play. 

	This past month, I have been able to see my family for the first time in a long time. Something that I really really really really needed. Although I have spent an hour a day skimming over code books, I mostly am not very focused on them - because the only thing I want to do is spend the day with my family, going to the beach and making fart jokes with my younger siblings. (yeah, I went there...)

	I will tell you this much though, ever since I started enjoying myself again and started reading instead of panicking over my textbooks - I can feel my mind opening up again. My back doesn't hurt anymore and I started making healthier eting choices as well, again.

	I am starting to finally feel like myself again.

	So yes, I am sorry that I have not stuck to this project like I wanted to, or even typed up a small blog everyday - but frankly, I am not gonna beat myself up over it. I just want to enjoy myself. 

	I want to start having positive visions again, of myself and of my future.

	The best of me is yet to come - I am currently under construction.
