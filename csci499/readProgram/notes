Meeting with Rader April 11, 2013
---------------------------------------

Regarding Refactoring:

- the sizes are repeated lots of places 
- magic constants are literal implementations
- make constants and values up top **DON'T BURY VALUES**
- be more descriptive about error messages - especially when using the same error places in multiple places, ask yourself if that is a good idea
- whenever you are gonna add numbers in code, ask about it critically

- instead of hardcoding and putting in locations, you can just getThem

- click and search for references on any function

for isTargetHit()
- can change parameters to methods, so that way you can have DRY
- case 1, have a flag for setWon
	- pass in the value that changes, y coordinate
	- and whether it's the fourth time
	- final time could be a boolean

- you tend to do less loops in event driven programming because the user is
clicking and doing something else

- if you have too many constants, that can be bad. but sizes are fine.

- 70% of the numbers you can change and do something else

- if it's a case that would be easier to draw interface, drawable, and all of the component classes can just call them; commmon functionality, not a class based hierarchy
	- unless they all already have their own array
