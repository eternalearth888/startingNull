The closer the angle is to 90 degrees, the greater the peak of its motion
To calculate the horizontal velocity, multiply velocity by cos(angle in radians)!
In real life situations, With constant acceleration, the distance traveled is equal to average velocity * time.
The closer the angle to 0 degrees, the lower its peak of motion.
The launch speed, angle, and the value of gravity determines the position and velocity at any time
Make sure to break the velocity down into horizonatal and vertical components, using cos and sin of your angle respectively
Don't fret! If you are unsure of your solution, it may be beneficial to sacrifice some health to visually see if your calculation is correct
Pick many time values and plot the horizonatal and vertical values until you can define the trajectory the missile at your angle will travel
The equation for distance traveled is distance = velocity*sin(angle)/gravity
Remember that the trajectory of a perfect projectile (over a flat surface without air resistance) is shaped as a parabola
