RULES: 
Take a look at the velocity, and choose an angle that will result in a successful hit of the cake. 
Be sure to save your angle before you launch, or the angle will not be changed, and Mint Pudding  
will be catapulted at an angle of Zero degrees. When you're happy with your saved angle, be sure to click launch and test your abilities! 
At the end of each round, the angle will reset to zero, and you;'l have to pick a new one.
