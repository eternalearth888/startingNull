	1. First go around the outer edges of the network
		a. Turn all corners so that they are facing inwards
		b. Turn all 'T' shaped pipes so that their long side is parallel with the blank spot
		c. Turn all long pipes so that they are parallel with the blank spot

	2. Next look to see if there are any long bars between two computers.
		a. If there are any, they must NOT be connecting the two computers or else that would be close loop.
		b. Make sure it is perpendicular to the two computers.

	3. When there are two or more long pipes next to eachother or  even a 'T' pipe and a long pipe, they must ALL face the same direction. The 'T' long side must be 		parallel with the long pipe.

	4. If a corner pipe and a long pipe are next to eachother, the corner must be have it's long/flat side face the corner. 

	5. If there is ever a long pipe in between two computers, it cannot connect the two computers because that would be a close loop.

	6. If you know a conern cannot attach on one side, you know that it can attach on the opposite side.

	7. When a piece has as many possible attachment points as it has things to attach to, then it must be rotated to attach to all of them.

	8. If the number of place it can attach to are greater than the number of attachment points it has, it must be rotated to avoid all of them
