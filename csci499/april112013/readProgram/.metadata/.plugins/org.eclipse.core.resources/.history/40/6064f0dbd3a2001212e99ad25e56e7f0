	Young Mint Pudding, a charming pony full of heart with a big appetite,

	the land one day as she trots home. Against the better judgment of her 
	friends (and her own common sense) she decides that she has to launch 
	herself from a catapult in order to consume the cake. So, Mint Pudding 
	risks her life to catapult with your help (and immense knowledge of 
	angles and trajectories) and hopefully hit the glorious cake of strawberry. 
	With each successful launch on the cake, Mint Pudding will devour a layer 
	of the cake (she has a VERY big mouth), but with each failed attempt, she 
	will lose a portion of her health. If she fails to consume all of the cake 
	before her health is depleted, little Mint Pudding will not see the next sunrise�
